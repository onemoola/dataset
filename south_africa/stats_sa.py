    # South African Economic Statistics

    This notebook ingests disparate datasets from StatsSA - including physical consumer prices, macroeconomic indices, and residential property metrics - and transforms them into a single, unified schema to visualise on the [Dataseka](https://www.dataseka.com) platform.

    The core steps of the data pipeline are:
    1. **Extract:** Fetch the raw data from [StatsSA](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1847).
    2. **Transform:** Process and clean each input into a standardized format.
    3. **Load:** Save the unified data as a CSV file for import into [Dataseka](https://www.dataseka.com).

    ### Add imports

    We need to bring in Polars for data manipulation, Plotly for visualisations, and our custom ingestion and transformation modules.

    ```python
    import polars as pl
    import polars.selectors as cs
    import plotly.express as px

    from ingestions import cpi as cpi_ingestion
    from transformations import cpi as cpi_transformations

    DATA_FOLDER = "./data"
    ```
    """)
    return

    ### 1. Ingest Raw Data

    Here we define the target list of StatsSA release files and dynamically construct their download URLs. The pipeline then loops through the list and asynchronously fetches the ZIP files, saving them to our local data directory without freezing the notebook.

    **💡 Future Improvement:** The filenames currently contain hardcoded release dates (e.g., `202604`). To make this pipeline fully automated, a future iteration should dynamically get the data from the StatsSA website.

    ```python
    filenames = [
        "P0141 - CPI(COICOP) from Jan 2008 (202604).zip",
        "P0141 - CPI Average Prices Provinces (202604).zip",
        "P0141 - CPI Average Prices All urban (202604).zip",
        "P0160 Residential Property Price Index Report(202601).zip"
    ]

    for filename in filenames:
        url = f"https://www.statssa.gov.za/../timeseriesdata/Excel/{filename}"

        await cpi_ingestion.download(url=url)
    ```

    return

    mo.md(r"""
    ### 2. Extract and Transform Source Data

    In this step, we read the unzipped Excel spreadsheets into memory and route them through their respective source adapters. To maximize speed and avoid false-positive string parsing bugs, we pass `infer_schema_length=0` so that Polars accurately reads the raw sheets before casting data types during transformation.

    Now that all four data sources have been converted into our identical target format, we merge them into a single unified table. This master dataset is then exported as a flat CSV file, optimised and ready for immediate ingestion into [Dataseka](https://dataseka.com).

    ```python
